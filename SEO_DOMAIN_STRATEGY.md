## üîç Brandable vs. Exact-Match Domains in 2025

### The SEO Landscape Has Changed

According to recent industry research (NameSilo, SearchEngineLand, 2025):

**Exact-Match Domains (EMDs) like "PromptOptimizer.com":**
- ‚ùå No longer provide automatic ranking boost
- ‚ùå Often viewed as spammy by users
- ‚ùå Limited branding flexibility
- ‚ùå Harder to scale beyond niche
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Susceptible to algorithm penalties
- ‚úÖ Can provide faster initial traffic (if done right)

**Brandable Domains like "Promptyze.com":**
- ‚úÖ Build long-term brand equity
- ‚úÖ Higher user trust over time
- ‚úÖ Better E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust)
- ‚úÖ Easier to trademark and protect
- ‚úÖ Scales across products and markets
- ‚úÖ Higher resale value
- ‚úÖ Better for venture capital/investment
- ‚è≥ Takes longer to build initial traction

## üéØ Why Brandable Domains Win in 2025

### 1. Google's Algorithm Evolution

**Google's EMD Update (2012) + Helpful Content Updates (2022-2025):**

- Favors established brands with authority

**What Google Actually Ranks:**

**Brandable domains excel at ALL of these over time.**

### 2. User Trust Psychology

- **Partnerships:** More professional for B2B deals
