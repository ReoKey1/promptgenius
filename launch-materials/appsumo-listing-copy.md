## Full Description

### The Problem

You're using ChatGPT, Claude, or other AI tools every day. But your results are inconsistent. Sometimes you get exactly what you need. Other times, it's completely off.

The problem isn't the AI. **It's your prompts.**

Most people write prompts like they're talking to a human. But AI needs structure, context, and specificity. Without prompt engineering skills, you're leaving 80% of AI's potential on the table.

You've tried:
- ❌ Copying prompts from the internet (too generic)
- ❌ Trial-and-error (wastes hours)
- ❌ Prompt libraries (150,000 prompts you'll never use)
- ❌ Basic prompt generators (no quality control)

**None of them make your prompts *better*.**

### The Solution

**PromptGenius is the only platform that optimizes your prompts.**

Instead of just storing or generating prompts, PromptGenius analyzes every prompt you write and gives you:

✅ **Quality Score (0-100)** - Know instantly if your prompt is good or needs work  
✅ **Improvement Suggestions** - Specific, actionable tips to make it better  
✅ **Version History** - Track how your prompts evolve over time  
✅ **Brand Voice Consistency** - Ensure all prompts match your brand  
✅ **Template Library** - Start with proven, high-quality templates  

**It's like Grammarly for AI prompts.**

### How It Works

1. **Write or paste your prompt** into PromptGenius
2. **Get instant quality score** based on prompt engineering best practices
